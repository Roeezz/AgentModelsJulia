# AgentModelsJulia

## Introduction
This repository is an effort to translate the book "Modeling Agents with Probabilistic Programs" written by Owain Evans, Andreas Stuhlm√ºller, John Salvatier, and Daniel Filan.

This is a project under the supervision of Dr. David Tolpin from BGU's CS department.

## Links
- The book can be found [here](https://agentmodels.org/). The code for the book is written in WebPPL, a general introduction to it can be found [here](http://dippl.org/).
- We use [Julia](https://julialang.org/) with the probablistic programming language [Gen](https://www.gen.dev/). Both have great documentation and tutorials you can read to better comprehend their uses.
