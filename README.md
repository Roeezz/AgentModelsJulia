# AgentModelsJulia

## Introduction
This repository is an effort to translate the book "Modeling Agents with Probabilistic Programs" written by Owain Evans, Andreas Stuhlm√ºller, John Salvatier, and Daniel Filan.

This is a project under the supervision of Dr. David Tolpin from BGU's CS department.

## Links
- The book can be found (https://agentmodels.org/)[here]. The code for the book is written in WebPPL, a general introduction to it can be found (http://dippl.org/)[here].
- We use (https://julialang.org/)[Julia] with the probablistic programming language (https://www.gen.dev/)[Gen]. Both have great documentation and tutorials you can read to better comprehend their uses.
