    "The previous chapter introduced agent models for solving simple, one-shot decision problems. The next few sections introduce *sequential* problems, where an agent's choice of action *now* depends on the actions they will choose in the future. As in game theory, the decision maker must coordinate with another rational agent. But in sequential decision problems, that rational agent is their future self.\n",

    "As a simple illustration of a sequential decision problem, suppose that an agent, Bob, is looking for a place to eat. Bob gets out of work in a particular location (indicated below by the blue circle). He knows the streets and the restaurants nearby. His decision problem is to take a sequence of actions such that (a) he eats at a restaurant he likes and (b) he does not spend too much time walking. Here is a visualization of the street layout. The labels refer to different types of restaurants: a chain selling Donuts, a Vegetarian Salad Bar and a Noodle Shop."

    "## Markov Decision Processes: Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent Bob's decision problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and, more specifically, as a discrete \"Gridworld\" environment. An MDP is a tuple $ \\left\\langle S,A(s),T(s,a),U(s,a) \\right\\rangle$, including the *states*, the *actions* in each state, the *transition function* that maps state-action pairs to successor states, and the *utility* or *reward* function. In our example, the states $S$ are Bob's locations on the grid. At each state, Bob selects an action $a \\in \\{ \\text{up}, \\text{down}, \\text{left}, \\text{right} \\} $, which moves Bob around the grid (according to transition function $T$). In this example we assume that Bob's actions, as well as the transitions and utilities, are all deterministic. However, our approach generalizes to noisy actions, stochastic transitions and stochastic utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the one-shot decisions of the previous chapter, the agent in an MDP will choose actions that *maximize expected utility*. This depends on the total utility of the *sequence* of states that the agent visits. Formally, let $EU_{s}[a]$ be the expected (total) utility of action $a$ in state $s$. The agent's choice is a softmax function of this expected utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "C(a; s) \\propto e^{\\alpha EU_{s}[a]}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected utility depends on both immediate utility and, recursively, on future expected utility:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"recursion\">**Expected Utility Recursion**</a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "EU_{s}[a] = U(s, a) + \\mathbb{E}_{s', a'}(EU_{s'}[a'])\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "with the next state $s' \\sim T(s,a)$ and $a' \\sim C(s')$. The decision problem ends either when a *terminal* state is reached or when the time-horizon is reached. (In the next few chapters the time-horizon will always be finite). \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition to keep in mind for solving MDPs is that the expected utility propagates backwards from future states to the current action. If a high utility state can be reached by a sequence of actions starting from action $a$, then action $a$ will have high expected utility -- *provided* that the sequence of actions is taken with high probability and there are no low utility steps along the way."

    "The recursive decision rule for MDP agents can be directly translated into WebPPL. The `act` function takes the agent's state as input, evaluates the expectation of actions in that state, and returns a softmax distribution over actions. The expected utility of actions is computed by a separate function `expectedUtility`. Since an action's expected utility depends on future actions, `expectedUtility` calls `act` in a mutual recursion, bottoming out when a terminal state is reached or when time runs out. \n",
