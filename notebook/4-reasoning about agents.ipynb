    "## Introduction\n",
    "The previous chapters have shown how to compute optimal actions for agents in MDPs and POMDPs. In many practical applications, this is the goal. For example, when controlling a robot, the goal is for the robot to act optimally given its utility function. When playing the stock market or poker, the goal is make money and one might use an approach based on the POMDP agent model from the [previous chapter](/chapters/3c-pomdp).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other settings, however, the goal is to *learn* or *reason about* an agent based on their behavior. For example, in social science or psychology researchers often seek to learn about people's preferences (denoted $U$) and beliefs (denoted $b$). The relevant *data* (denoted $\\{a_i\\}$) are usually observations of human actions. In this situation, models of optimal action can be used as *generative models* of human actions. The generative model predicts the behavior *given* preferences and beliefs. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P( \\{a_i\\} \\vert U, b)  =: \\text{Generative model of optimal action}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical inference infers the preferences $U$ and beliefs $b$ *given* the observed actions $\\{a_i\\}$. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P( U, b \\vert \\{a_i\\})  =: \\text{Invert generative model via statistical inference}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach, using generative models of sequential decision making, has been used to learn preferences and beliefs about education, work, health, and many other topics[^generative].\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent models are also used as generative models in Machine Learning, under the label \"Inverse Reinforcement Learning\" (IRL). One motivation for learning human preferences and beliefs is to give humans helpful recommendations (e.g. for products they are likely to enjoy). A different goal is to build systems that mimic human expert performance. For some tasks, it is hard for humans to directly specify a utility/reward function that is both correct and that can be tractably optimized. An alternative is to *learn* the human's utility function by watching them perform the task. Once learned, the system can use standard RL techniques to optimize the function. This has been applied to building systems to park cars, to fly helicopters, to control human-like bots in videogames, and to play table tennis[^inverse].\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides an array of illustrative examples of learning about agents from their actions. We begin with a concrete example and then provide a general formalization of the inference problem. A virtue of using WebPPL is that doing inference over our existing agent models requires very little extra code.\n",

    "Consider the MDP version of Bob's Restaurant Choice problem. Bob is choosing between restaurants, all restaurants are open (and Bob knows this), and Bob also knows the street layout. Previously, we discussed how to compute optimal behavior *given* Bob's utility function over restaurants. Now we infer Bob's utility function *given* observations of the behavior in the codebox:"

    "We will now formalize the kind of inference in the previous example. We begin by considering inference over the utilities and softmax noise parameter for an MDP agent. Later on we'll generalize to POMDP agents and to other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Chapter 3.1](/chapters/3a-mdp.html) the MDP agent is defined by a utility function $U$ and softmax parameter $\\alpha$. In order to do inference, we need to know the agent's starting state $s_0$ (which might include both their *location* and their *time horizon* $N$). The data we condition on is a sequence of state-action pairs:\n",

    "The index for the final timestep is less than or equal to the time horzion:  $n \\leq N$. We abbreviate this sequence as $(s,a)_{0:n}$. The joint posterior on the agent's utilities and noise given the observed state-action sequence is:\n",

    "where the likelihood function $P( {(s,a)}_{0:n} \\vert U, \\alpha )$ is the MDP agent model (for simplicity we omit information about the starting state). Due to the Markov Assumption for MDPs, the probability of an agent's action in a state is independent of the agent's previous or later actions (given $U$ and $\\alpha$). This allows us to rewrite the posterior as **Equation (1)**:\n",

This equation holds for the case where we observe a sequence of actions from timestep $0$ to $n \\leq N$ (with no gaps). This tutorial focuses mostly on this case. It is trivial to extend the equation to observing multiple independently drawn such sequences (as we show below). However, if there are gaps in the sequence or if we observe only the agent's states (not the actions), then we need to marginalize over actions that were unobserved.\n",

So we never get any information about whether they prefer the Vegetarian Cafe or Noodle Shop!\n",

    "Unidentifiability is a frequent problem when inferring an agent's beliefs or utilities from realistic datasets. First, agents with low noise reliably avoid inferior states (as in the present example) and so their actions provide little information about the relative utilities among the inferior states. Second, using richer agent models means there are more possible explanations of the same behavior. For example, agents with high softmax noise or with false beliefs might go to a restaurant even if they don't prefer it. One general approach to the problem of unidentifiability in IRL is **active learning**. Instead of passively observing the agent's actions, you select a sequence of environments that will be maximally informative about the agent's preferences. For recent work covering both the nature of unidentifiability in IRL as well as the active learning approach, see reft:amin2016towards.\n",

    "## Learning about agents in POMDPs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formalization\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend our approach to inference to deal with agents that solve POMDPs. One approach to inference is simply to generate full state-action sequences and compare them to the observed data. As we mentioned above, this approach becomes intractable in cases where noise (in transitions and actions) is high and sequences are long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we extend the approach in Equation (1) above. The first thing to notice is that Equation (1) has to be amended for POMDPs. In an MDP, actions are conditionally independent given the agent's parameters $U$ and $\\alpha$ and the state. For any pair of actions $a_{i}$ and $a_j$ and state $s_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(a_i \\vert a_j, s_i, U,\\alpha) = P(a_i \\vert s_i, U,\\alpha)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a POMDP, actions are only rendered conditionally independent if we also condition on the agent's *belief*. So Equation (1) can only be extended to the case where we know the agent's belief at each timestep. This will be realistic in some applications and not others. It depends on whether the agent's *observations* are part of the data that is conditioned on. If so, the agent's belief can be computed at each timestep (assuming the agent's initial belief is known). If not, we have to marginalize over the possible observations, making for a more complex inference computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the extension of Equation (1) to the POMDP case, where we assume access to the agent's observations. <a id=\"pomdpDefine\"></a>Our goal is to compute a posterior on the parameters of the agent. These include $U$ and $\\alpha$ as before but also the agent's initial belief $b_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe a sequence of state-observation-action triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(s_0,o_0,a_0), (s_1,o_1,a_1), \\ldots, (s_n,o_n,a_n)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The index for the final timestep is at most the time horzion:  $n \\leq N$. The joint posterior on the agent's utilities and noise given the observed sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(U,\\alpha, b_0 | (s,o,a)_{0:n}) \\propto P( (s,o,a)_{0:n} | U, \\alpha, b_0)P(U, \\alpha, b_0)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a factorized form of this posterior analogous to Equation (1), we compute the sequence of agent beliefs. This is given by the recursive Bayesian belief update described in [Chapter 3.3](/chapters/3c-pomdp):\n",

    "### Application: Bandits\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn the preferences and beliefs of a POMDP agent we translate Equation (2) into WebPPL. In a later [chapter](/chapters/5e-joint-inference.html), we apply this to the Restaurant Choice problem. Here we focus on the Bandit problems introduced in the [previous chapter](/chapters/3c-pomdp).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bandit problems there is an unknown mapping from arms to non-numeric prizes (or distributions on such prizes) and the agent has preferences over these prizes. The agent tries out arms to discover the mapping and exploits the most promising arms. In the *inverse* problem, we get to observe the agent's actions. Unlike the agent, we already know the mapping from arms to prizes. However, we don't know the agent's preferences or the agent's prior about the mapping[^bandit].\n",
    "\n",
    "[^bandit]: If we did not know the mapping from arms to prizes, the inference problem would not change fundamentally. We get information about this mapping by observing the prizes the agent receives when pulling different arms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the agent's choices admit of multiple explanations. Recall the deterministic example in the previous chapter when (according to the agent's belief) `arm0` had the prize \"chocolate\" and `arm1` had either \"champagne\" or \"nothing\" (see also Figure 2 below). Suppose we observe the agent chosing `arm0` on the first of five trials. If we don't know the agent's utilities or beliefs, then this choice could be explained by either:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). the agent's preference for chocolate over champagne, or\n",
    "\n",
    "(2). the agent's belief that `arm1` is very likely (e.g. 95%) to yield the \"nothing\" prize deterministically\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this choice by the agent, we won't be able to identify which of (1) and (2) is true because exploration becomes less valuable every trial (and there's only 5 trials total).\n",
    "\n",
    "The codeboxes below implements this example. The translation of Equation (2) is in the function `factorSequence`. This function iterates through the observed state-observation-action triples, updating the agent's belief at each timestep. It interleaves conditioning on an action (via `factor`) with computing the sequence of belief functions $b_i$. The variable names correspond as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "This example of inferring an agent's utilities from a Bandit problem may seem contrived. However, there are practical problems that have a similar structure. Consider a domain where $k$ **sources** (arms) produce a stream of content, with each piece of content having a **category** (prizes). At each timestep, a human is observed choosing a source. The human has uncertainty about the stochastic mapping from sources to categories. Our goal is to infer the human's beliefs about the sources and their preferences over categories. The sources could be blogs or feeds that tag posts using the same set of tags. Alternatively, the sources could be channels for TV shows or songs. In this kind of application, the same issue of identifiability arises.
